# Concurrent-Socket-Server
  I worked with a fellow classmate on this project which implements a concurrent (multi-threaded) server and client system using Java sockets to study the effects of concurrency on server responsiveness and efficiency. The goal is to simulate and analyze how a multi-threaded server handles multiple simultaneous client requests and to measure the turn-around time for each client. Students were tasked with building two programs: a multi-threaded server that listens for client connections and spawns a new thread to handle each request, and a multi-threaded client that generates multiple parallel requests to stress-test the server. The server supports six operations that retrieve system information (Date and Time, Uptime, Memory Use, Netstat, Current Users, and Running Processes) by executing corresponding Linux commands. The client connects to the server, specifies a command and number of requests (1â€“100), and collects timing data for each transaction. The collected data, including individual, total, and average turn-around times, is then analyzed to compare the performance of concurrent vs. iterative server models. This project emphasizes the practical benefits of concurrency in distributed systems and strengthens skills in socket programming, multithreading, system command execution, and performance benchmarking.
  As part of the project, students were required to write a formal report of at least 1,000 words detailing their design, implementation, testing, and analysis of a concurrent socket server system. The report includes sections such as an introduction, client-server setup and configuration, testing and data collection, data analysis, conclusion, and lessons learned. Students were expected to explain their design decisions, describe how they collected and analyzed performance data (including charts and tables), and compare the results with an iterative server. The essay also aimed to reflect on the learning experience, including technical challenges overcome and key insights gained throughout the project.
